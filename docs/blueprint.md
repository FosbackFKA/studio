## Core Features:

- Visual clone: Replicate the front page of nye.felleskjopet.no visually
- Resizing adjustments: Allow for adjusting of sizes in the visual clone

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated muted blue (#536F8B), evoking reliability and tradition found on the Felleskjøpet website.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), providing a clean and neutral backdrop to enhance the visual elements. Almost same hue as primary color, very low saturation, and high brightness to establish a light scheme.
- Accent color: Soft, muted teal (#538B6F), complementing the primary blue-gray to suggest subtle differences for key interactive elements and to indicate a local or "grounded" interaction.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to achieve a modern, clean aesthetic for enhanced readability and visual clarity. 
- Use icons consistent with the existing Felleskjøpet site, mainly line icons with a modern, simple design. 
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure consistent spacing and alignment. The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
